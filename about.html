				<p class="callout">David Foster Wallace was an American author of novels, short stories, and essays.</p>
				<p>He spent his childhood in Urbana, Illinois, where he became a regionally ranked junior tennis player. Tennis would later feature heavily into Wallace&rsquo;s widely known novel, <a href="books/infinite-jest.html"><em>Infinite Jest</em></a>. He would become in 2002 a professor of creative writing at Pomona College.</p>
				<p>Wallace&rsquo;s writing is not known for its terseness. Some of his sentences seem to never end. A signature of his style is the extensive use of footnotes (both to clarify points in the main text and in some cases to continue the main story), which Wallace described as interrupting narrative as thought is interrupted. His work is often concerned with irony, particularly as it contribues to contemporary American culture. While his text often uses various ironic devices, Wallace always sought an earnest, unselfconcious experience.</p>
				<p>Wallace is equally known for his fiction as his non-fiction. Though not strictly a journalist, Wallace covered all manner of topics for various publications, including <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>. Outside of <em>Infinite Jest</em>, many of his most well-known works are essays, including <em>Consider the Lobster</em> and <a href="books/a-supposedly-fun-thing.html"><em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again</em></a>.
				<p>David Foster Wallace took his own life in 2008.</p>
