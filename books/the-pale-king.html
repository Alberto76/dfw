				<p class="callout"><em>The Pale King</em> is Wallace&rsquo;s last and unfinished novel.</p>
				<img src="../img/books/the-pale-king.jpg"/>
				<p class="text">After Wallace&rsquo;s death in 2008, his editor Michael Pietsch assembled the novel from a manuscript, notes, and related files. Wallace had been working on the novel for more than a decade. Each of the fifty chapters could almost stand alone, leading Pietsch to regard the book&rsquo;s organization &ldquo;a challenge like none I&rsquo;ve encountered.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="text">Like <em>Infinite Jest</em>, <em>The Pale King</em> is set in near-future America. The novel, according to Pietsch, takes &ldquo;agonizing daily events&rdquo; &mdash; such as standing in lines and waiting in traffic &rdquo; and turns them into moments of insight. Several of the characters are in the employ of the I.R.S. in Peoria, Illinois, and one is named David Wallace in a fictionalized version of the author.</p>
				<p class="text">Though <em>The Pale King</em> is unfinished, it has been generally well-received by critics. It is not considered as influential on modern American fiction as Wallace&rsquo;s earlier work, but still received a nomination for the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, though no award was given in the category that year.</p>

				<h1>Opening Line</h1>
				<blockquote>Past the flannel plains and blacktop graphs and skylines of canted rust, and past the tobacco-brown river overhung with weeping trees and coins of sunlight through them on the water downriver, to the place beyond the windbreak, where untilled fields simmer shrilly in the a.m. heat: shattercane, lamb&rsquo;s-quarter, cutgrass, sawbrier, nutgrass, jimsonweed, wild mint, dandelion, foxtail, muscadine, spinecabbage, goldenrod, creeping charlie, butter-print, nightshade, ragweed, wild oat, vetch, butcher grass, invaginate volunteer beans, all heads gently nodding in a morning breeze like a mother&rsquo;s soft hand on your cheek.</blockquote>

				<p>It was in trying to capture that hectic, chaotic reality — and the nuanced, conflicted, ever-mutating thoughts of his characters — that Wallace’s synesthetic prose waxed so prolix, his sentences unspooling into tangled skeins of words, replete with qualifying phrases and garrulous footnotes. And this is why his novels, stories and articles so often defied closure and grew and grew and grew, sprouting tendrils and digressions and asides — because in almost everything Wallace wrote, including “The Pale King,” he aimed to use words to lasso and somehow subdue the staggering, multifarious, cacophonous predicament that is modern American life. <cite>Michiko Kakutani, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/books/the-pale-king-by-david-foster-wallace-book-review.html">New York Times</a></p>
