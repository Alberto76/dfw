				<p class="callout"><em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again</em> is Wallace&rsquo;s 1997 collection of nonfiction, his first book to compile his now-famous essays. It includes personal and persuasive essays, as well as long-form journalism.</p>
				<img src="../img/books/supposedly-fun-thing.jpg"/>
				<p class="text">The book&rsquo;s title essay, originally published in <em>Harper&rsquo;s</em> as &ldquo;Shipping Out&rdquo;, concerns Wallace&rsquo;s one-week cruise in the Caribbean aboard the MV <em>Zenith</em>, which Wallace renames the <em>Nadir</em>. The essay describes the excesses of the cruise and its crew&rsquo;s hospitality, and the irony of a week of relaxation that leads to deep internal despair. The essay makes extensive use of footnotes for asides, clarifications, and even narrative, in what has become a key feature of Wallace&rsquo;s unique style.</p>
				<p class="text">The book&rsquo;s other essays include &ldquo;Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley&rdquo;, Wallace&rsquo;s coming-of-age-through-tennis story, and &ldquo;E Unibus Pluram&rdquo;, an essay concerning the influence of television and America&rsquo;s culture of irony on contemporary literature.</p>

				<h1>Collected Essays and First Lines</h1>
				<li>
					<h2>Derivative Sport in Tornado Alley</h2>
					<p>When I left my boxed township of Illinois farmland to attend my dad&rsquo;s alma mater in the lurid jutting Berkshires of western Massachusetts, I all of a sudden developed a jones for mathematics.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>E Unibus Pluram: Television and US Fiction</h2>
					<p>Fiction writers as a species tend to be oglers. They tend to lurk and to stare. The minute fiction writers stop moving, they start lurking, and stare.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Getting Away from Already Being Pretty Much Away from It All</h2>
					<p>Today is Press Day at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield, and I'm supposed to be at the fair grounds by 9:00 A.M. to get my credentials, I imagine credentials to be a small white card in the band of a fedora.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Greatly Exaggerated</h2>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>David Lynch Keeps His Head</h2>
					<p>Lost Highway is set in Los Angeles and the desertish terrain immediately inland from it.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>Tennis Player Michael Joyce&rsquo;s Professional Artistry as a Paradigm Shift of Certain Stuff about Choice, Freedom, Discipline, Joy, Grotesquerie, and Human Completeness</h2>
					<p>When Michael T. Joyce of Los Angeles serves, when he tosses the ball and his face rises to track it, it looks like he’s smiling, but he’s not really smiling &mdash; his face’s circumoral muscles are straining with the rest of his body to reach the ball at the top of the toss’s rise.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h2>A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again</h2>
					<p>I have now seen sucrose beaches and water a very bright blue. I have seen an all-red leisure suit with flared lapels. [ have smelled suntan lotion spread over 2,100 pounds of hot flesh. I have been addressed as "Mon" in three different nations. I have seen 500 upscale Americans dance the Electric Slide. I have seen sunsets that looked computer-enhanced. I have (very briefly) joined a conga line.</p>

				<p>&ldquo;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again&rdquo; should settle the matter at last. This collection of &ldquo;essays and arguments&rdquo; &mdash; originally published in Harper&rsquo;s, Esquire and Premiere, among other magazines &mdash; reveals Mr. Wallace in ways that his fiction has of yet managed to dodge: as a writer struggling mightily to understand and capture his times, as a critic who cares deeply about &ldquo;serious&rdquo; art, and as a mensch. [&hellip;] Mr. Wallace's distinctive and infectious style, an acrobatic cartwheeling between high intellectual discourse and vernacular insouciance, makes him tremendously entertaining to read, whatever his subject. &ldquo;A Supposedly Fun Thing I&rsquo;ll Never Do Again&rdquo; proves that his accomplishment is far more than just a stunt. <cite>Laura Miller, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/16/news/a-supposedly-fun-thing-i-ll-never-do-again.html">New York Times</a></p>
